# Integrated-Project-Understanding-the-yield-LinearRegression-
we analyse the relationship between various features and the standard yield of a farm to predict future yields. We utilise scatter plots and correlation coefficients to explore linear relationships, fit linear regression models, and evaluate these models using R-squared, MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics.
